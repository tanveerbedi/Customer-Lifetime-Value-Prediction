# 🧠 Customer Lifetime Value Prediction

> 🔬 Internship Project @ Celebal Technologies
> 👤 Developed by **Tanveer Singh**
> 🚀 Predicting Customer Lifetime Value using Machine Learning

---

## 📌 Overview

This project is part of my internship at **Celebal Technologies**, where the objective was to build a predictive model that estimates **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** from historical customer behavior data. By leveraging customer segmentation and advanced machine learning techniques, the solution aims to provide actionable business insights that drive marketing and retention strategies.
